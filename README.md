# Climb_Hard
Welcome to Climb_Hard,
an analysis of the factors that affect performance in lead climbing from a machine learning and bayesian statistic point of view.
The bayesian analysis was performed for the 'Applied Statistical Modelling' course; it involved the implemention in R of a Gibbs sampler to analyze multinomial ordered climbing data.
The preparation of the data were done using Pandas and a comparison with a machine learning model using scikit-learn will follow.
